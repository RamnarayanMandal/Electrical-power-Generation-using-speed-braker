<strong>Overview</strong> 
Speed Breaker Electrical Power Generation with Gears and Pinions is a sustainable energy project designed to harness the kinetic energy produced by vehicles passing over speed breakers. This project utilizes gear and pinion mechanisms to efficiently convert the linear motion of vehicles into rotational motion, which is then transformed into electrical power.
